        <h3>Our passion is to <span class=yellow>illuminate</span> your world through <span class="yellow">taste</span></h3>
        <p>The human race is an incredibly adventurous species by nature. Subconsciously we seek to stimulate each of our senses by embarking on new experiences throughout day to day life. Each sense can have it's own feeling of euphoria; the feeling of seeing a spetacular view for the first time, the sensation of listening to a masterpiece of a song for the first time, that new smell that will now remind you of a momentus occusion in your life, the relief of that massage that your body has been craving for a lifetime and the phenomenon of tasting your favourite meal for the first time.</p>
